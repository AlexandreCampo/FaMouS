To work with fss, you need bullet. We currently use a _modified_ version of bullet-2.78. 

Install bullet : 

- download the sources of bullet 2.78 at http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/list
- replace the file src/BulletDynamics/Dynamics/btRigidBody.h with the one we provide
- ./configure && make && make install


Why a modified version ? 

We implemented some basic underwater dynamics, and for this we had to create a different
rigid body class, which we called btUnderwaterRigidBody. This new class derives from a 
btRigidBody and we had to make some methods virtual to allow overriding.
